### Hi there 👋, Hi there, my name is Khristine Joyce.
#### A student programmer👩‍💻, gamer👾, and an aviation enthusiast 🛫

So currently I am an SHS student based in Philippines and I'm currently studying Tec. Voc. ICT. I created this GitHub profile with the purpose of sharing some of my projects to serve as ideas and inspiration to my fellow students out there! 


Skills: Java/HTML/CSS/JS/Python/C#

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some of my personal projects and this page. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, PHP, everything really 😂 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with creating a personal portfolio for future employment use. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am technically still a newbie because I only learned how to code just last year.
