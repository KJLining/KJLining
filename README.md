### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Hi there, my name is Khristine Joyce.
#### A student, gamer, and a future aviatrix!

So currently I am an SHS student based in Philippines and I'm currently studying Tec. Voc. ICT. I created this GitHub profile with the purpose of sharing some of my projects to serve as ideas and inspiration to my fellow students out there! 


Skills: Java/HTML/CSS/Python

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some of my personal projects and this page. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, PHP, everything really ðŸ˜‚ 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating a personal portfolio for future employment use. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am technically still a newbie because I only learned how to code just last year.
